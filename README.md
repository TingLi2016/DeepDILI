### conventional_DNN
This folder includes three conventional Deep Neural Network (DNN) models developed from Mold2, Mol2vec and MACCS. For each conventional dnn model folder, it provides three profiles, including dataset (.csv), conventional dnn model (.h5) and python script (.py). Make sure repalce the file path of the dataset and model according to your directory on the python script.   

### DeepDILI
This folder includes three DeepDILI models developed from Mold2, Mol2vec and MACCS. In each folder, we give the readme.txt file for specific instruction about how to runing the model.  

### full_DeepdiLI
We use the full dataset(1009 compounds) as the training set to develop the DeepDILI model with Mold2. It includes three tables (.csv), one model (.h5), and one python script. Please make sure update the file (.csv and .h5) path on the python script. To screening your interested compounds, please update the test set path with your compounds' Mold2 descriptors.
